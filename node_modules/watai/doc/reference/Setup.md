Setup reference
===============

Setup files are configuration files that are transversal to all test suites and modify Watai's behavior globally. They contain a JavaScript hash that defines the behaviour of Watai when the suite will be executed, with the difference that they cannot be reconfigured after the application started, nor loaded from suite folders.

You should edit these values only if you need to debug Watai itself.

#### `log` ####

Defines the logging levels and transports.

Each key contains the associated [Winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston#README) setup hash.

The available categories are:

- `init`: information about Watai initialization; useful only if you want to debug Watai itself.
- `load`: information about loading and parsing of suite files.
