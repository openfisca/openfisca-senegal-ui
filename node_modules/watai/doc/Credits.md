Watai does not come out of nowhere. Its foundational ideas are the result of two months of research in the state of web testing, and inspiration from great predecessors.


Inspiration
-----------

Much material was sought and analysed to create this piece of software. Among inspirations were:

- [SauceLabs](http://saucelabs.com/) with [Test::Right](https://github.com/saucelabs/test_right) ([introduction article](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2011/05/testright-browser-testing-done-right/)).
- [4impact](http://www.4impact.com.au/) with [Madcow](http://madcow.4impact.net.au/).
- [Coverity](http://coverity.com/) with [Shelob](https://github.com/xirkus/shelob) ([introduction video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzj8UXdcElo)).
- [Dan Cuellar](http://linkedin.com/pub/dan-cuellar/3b/8a3/b57 )’s [Writing Well-Abstracted Self-Testing Automation On Top Of Jell-O](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lJBHx4EE00) speech: reflection importers, “self-test” methods in application code, abstract features with per-platform implementation.
