How to upgrade your tests from Watai 0.6 to 0.7
===============================================

The main difference between 0.6 and 0.7 is a rename of all concepts, to align with the current common vocabulary on the web.

**A [script](https://gist.github.com/MattiSG/0874220df30c98ee149f) is available to automate all files renames!**
You will still need a bit of manual work to fully upgrade. Read details below.


Widgets
-------

Widgets are now named Components.

To upgrade, simply change all `Widget` to `Component`, both in file names and in matching references.

> Retro-compatibility is present and your Widgets files will still load, but naming your files Widget is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.


Features
--------

Features are now named Scenarios.

The inner `scenario` key is now named `steps`.

To upgrade, simply change all `Feature` in file names to `Scenario`, and change the `scenario` keys in them to `steps`.

> Retro-compatibility is present and your Features files will still load, but naming your files Feature and using the `scenario` key is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.


Data
----

Data are now named Fixtures.

To upgrade, simply change all `Data` in file names to `Fixture`.

> Retro-compatibility is present and your Data files will still load, but naming your files Data is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.


Async config
------------

If you used [async config elements](https://github.com/MattiSG/Watai/wiki/Configuration#async-config), make sure you upgraded from the deprecated callback syntax to relying on promises.

If you used the second parameter for forward compatibility, you can now safely remove it.
